## 🧠 How It Works

* The app uses **Pillow (ImageGrab)** to take screenshots repeatedly.
* Converts images to frames using **NumPy** and **OpenCV**.
* Writes frames to an MP4 file via **cv2.VideoWriter**.
* (Optional) Records system audio using **PyAudio**.
* The **Tkinter GUI** controls start, stop, and area selection.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

* Audio recording may not work on some systems (especially Linux without proper PulseAudio/ALSA setup).
* High resolutions (1080p+) may result in lower frame rates on older CPUs.
